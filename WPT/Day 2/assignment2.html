    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the fundamental structure and content of a webpage, 
        defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and images; CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
        then dictates the visual presentation of that content, controlling aspects such as colors,
         fonts, layout, and responsiveness; and JavaScript adds dynamic interactivity and functionality,
          allowing for animations, user input handling, and manipulation of the page's content and style in 
          response to user actions.</p>
